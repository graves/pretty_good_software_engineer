### Polyglot Princess

Hello internet. I am a lifelong polyglot Software Engineer residing on the east coast of the United States of America. I'm currently interested in the intersection of data science, class politics, journalism and using Natural Language Processing to explore the resulting dynamics. I remain forever fascinated by design patterns, effective documentation, open source, novel languages, and the [neighborly exchange of ideas](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/). I'm at my happiest cuddled up with a cup a coffee and a book, actualizing abstract concepts via friendly debate, or writing [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Smalltalk](https://pharo.org/), and [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) torwards some kind of disjointed and barely out of reach purpose.
